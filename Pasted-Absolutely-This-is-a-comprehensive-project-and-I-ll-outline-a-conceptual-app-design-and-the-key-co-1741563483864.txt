Absolutely! This is a comprehensive project, and I'll outline a conceptual app design and the key components needed to build it.

**App Name:** "Marking Maestro"

**Technology Stack (Conceptual - Adapt to your preference):**

* **Frontend:** React (for a dynamic, responsive UI) or Vue.js
* **Backend:** Python (with Flask or Django) or Node.js (with Express)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (for robust data management) or SQLite (for simplicity)
* **Gantt Chart Library:** DHTMLX Gantt or similar

**Core Features and Implementation Details:**

1.  **Data Import:**
    * **Staff Import:**
        * Allow CSV or Excel file uploads.
        * Fields: Teacher ID, Name, Email, Leave Dates (range), Class Allocations (JSON or comma-separated).
    * **Assessment Task Import:**
        * CSV or Excel upload.
        * Fields: Task ID, Task Name, Course, Year Group, Due Date, Number of Markers Required.
    * **Class Import:**
        * CSV or Excel upload.
        * Fields: Class ID, Class Name, Course, Year Group, Teacher ID, Student Count.

2.  **Marking Allocation Logic:**
    * **Initial Allocation:**
        * **One-Class Rule:** If a teacher teaches the only class for a course, automatically assign them to mark that class.
        * **Multiple-Class Rule:** If a teacher teaches multiple classes in a course, exclude their own classes from their marking allocation for that course.
        * **Leave Exclusion:** Check teacher leave dates against task due dates and the two-week marking window. Exclude teachers on leave.
        * **Minimal Overlap:**
            * Calculate the total marking load for each teacher (based on student numbers and task counts).
            * Distribute tasks to balance the load, prioritizing minimizing concurrent marking.
            * Use an algorithm (e.g., a greedy algorithm or a more sophisticated optimization algorithm) to distribute tasks fairly.
        * **Due Dates and Turnaround:**
            * Calculate the marking deadline (two weeks after the task due date).
            * Ensure tasks are allocated with sufficient time for marking.
        * **Number of Markers:**
            * Allow the user to set the number of markers per task within the assessment task import, and within the task itself.
            * When allocating, ensure the correct number of markers are assigned to each task.

3.  **Marker Assignment:**
    * Display a list of classes and available teachers.
    * Allow manual assignment of markers to specific classes within a task.
    * Provide warnings if assignments violate rules (e.g., teacher marking their own class).

4.  **Staffing Changes:**
    * Provide an interface to adjust marking allocations.
    * Allow reassignment of tasks to different teachers.
    * Automatically recalculate marking loads and due dates.

5.  **Gantt Chart Overview:**
    * Display a Gantt chart showing marking allocations over time.
    * Visualize task start and end dates for each teacher.
    * Allow filtering and sorting by teacher, course, or year group.
    * Use color coding to display status of marking such as completed, in progress, and not started.

6.  **Teacher Reports:**
    * Generate individual reports for each teacher.
    * Include:
        * List of tasks assigned.
        * Classes assigned.
        * Student numbers.
        * Due dates.
        * Marking deadlines.

7.  **Task Tracking:**
    * Provide a status field for each task (e.g., "Not Started," "In Progress," "Completed").
    * Allow teachers to update task status.
    * Display overall progress for administrators.
    * Provide a way to add comments to each task.

**Conceptual Workflow:**

1.  **Admin Imports Data:** Staff, assessment tasks, and classes.
2.  **System Performs Initial Allocation:** Based on the rules and algorithms.
3.  **Admin Reviews Allocation:** Checks for fairness and makes adjustments.
4.  **Teachers Receive Reports:** With their assigned marking tasks and deadlines.
5.  **Teachers Mark and Update Status:** Track progress within the app.
6.  **Admin Monitors Progress:** Uses the Gantt chart and reports.

**Key Considerations:**

* **User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX):** Design a clear and intuitive interface.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for data import and allocation.
* **Scalability:** Design the app to handle large datasets and multiple users.
* **Security:** Implement appropriate security measures to protect data.
* **Testing:** Thoroughly test the app to ensure accuracy and reliability.

**Example Python Code (Illustrative - Needs Expansion):**

```python
# Example of a simplified allocation function
def allocate_tasks(teachers, tasks, classes):
    allocation = {}
    # ... logic for allocation ...
    return allocation
```

**Building the App:**

1.  **Plan the Database Schema:** Define tables for teachers, tasks, classes, and allocations.
2.  **Develop the Backend API:** Create endpoints for data import, allocation, reporting, and task tracking.
3.  **Build the Frontend UI:** Design the interface for data input, task management, and reporting.
4.  **Integrate the Gantt Chart:** Use a library to visualize marking allocations.
5.  **Test and Deploy:** Thoroughly test the app and deploy it to a suitable environment.

This detailed outline should provide a strong foundation for building your "Marking Maestro" app. Remember to break down the development process into smaller, manageable tasks.
